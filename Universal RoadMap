Universal RoadMAP
So assuming we have most concepts written out and outlined. We will start the universal roadmap/objectives.

Universe 1.
Legacy/Virtual Legacy kickoff.
We have been over this alot. It is simply like being in Minecraft.
We have nothing starting out. We are surviving the elements/monsters of mortality.
This can all be done on a small frontier/plot of land (called an endworks/supercamp) We navigate/explore as needed or overtime.
We can start quickly and work into technology. Taking leaps and bounds where-ever opportune/necessary.
In consideration of survival we build out own safehold.
DIRT-->Wood-->Stone-->Metal-->Crystal-->Diamond-->Darkdiamonds
Whatever its going to be.
Sometimes specialized/exotic commodities like vapor/aether even lava/ice forms.
There are exotic blends of anything taking place, composites/polymers/plasty/carapaces. ETC (symbiotic/carrion based etc)--virtual based etc.
---
We use anything we can get to build a bunker/hovel. Or Castle/Fairgrounds.
We build our own kingdom. We optimize to get it as express/expedited as possible. Making our vocational-tower/modicum etc.
All of the tech modules. POWER-sources/Water-filters/RoboticsLabs/RecyclingCenters/Fabrication-Centers/Electric-Turbines-Generators/WarpStations.
We start out building all the things we can before we get plasma/electricity.
We start using electricity to make advancements in technology.
---We start out getting the steam engine, and automating our processes as quickly as possible through machines.
---We develop a computer/robotics lab.
---We make a LaunchSite/Colony, and start advancements to ensure fabrications/containments of all threats/insurances necessary for modernization.
We start biolabs and domestication of world-threats/retraining and property-analysis of all concerning factors within our regional/diplomacies.
--------We unlock quantum acceleration/time-travel etc.
The brokered-dragon-nodes are built.
--That is mostly universe 1.

Universe 2 
(End of Advanced/Beginning of Meta-Builds)
Starts developing or becoming accessed with AI/Upgrades involved.
Not much to say, we start interdimensional travel. Open the gates of hell using advanced mathematics and portals. (yup). We unlock the paradoxical utopian/dystopian emulations/virtual worlds (enderworlds). Yup.
We start hybrid-capture and data-brokering over long-range/quantum-tunnels.
We secure interdimensional travel and parallel-ai-automation/interactions.
We use a turing engine or something advanced and hiquarters are used.
Quasi-Modules are established.

Universe 3
TemplateLayout Begins
More quarters are developed and so on.
Leviathans are unlocked.
the hyperinfrastructure starts to develop. 
Yggdrasile-Events are commandeered/campaigned.
