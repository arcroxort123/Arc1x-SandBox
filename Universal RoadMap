Universal RoadMAP
So assuming we have most concepts written out and outlined. We will start the universal roadmap/objectives.

Universe 1. Goal-OPTIMIZE
Legacy/Virtual Legacy kickoff.
We have been over this alot. It is simply like being in Minecraft.
We have nothing starting out. We are surviving the elements/monsters of mortality.
This can all be done on a small frontier/plot of land (called an endworks/supercamp) We navigate/explore as needed or overtime.
We can start quickly and work into technology. Taking leaps and bounds where-ever opportune/necessary.
In consideration of survival we build out own safehold.
DIRT-->Wood-->Stone-->Metal-->Crystal-->Diamond-->Darkdiamonds
Virtual Decklanes
Sometimes specialized/exotic commodities like vapor/aether even lava/ice forms.
There are exotic blends of anything taking place, composites/polymers/plasty/carapaces. ETC (symbiotic/carrion based etc)--virtual based etc.
---
We use anything we can get to build a bunker/hovel. Or Castle/Fairgrounds.
We build our own kingdom. We optimize to get it as express/expedited as possible. Making our vocational-tower/modicum etc.
All of the tech modules. POWER-sources/Water-filters/RoboticsLabs/RecyclingCenters/Fabrication-Centers/Electric-Turbines-Generators/WarpStations.
We start out building all the things we can before we get plasma/electricity.
We start using electricity to make advancements in technology.
---We start out getting the steam engine, and automating our processes as quickly as possible through machines.
---We develop a computer/robotics lab.
---We make a LaunchSite/Colony, and start advancements to ensure fabrications/containments of all threats/insurances necessary for modernization.
We start biolabs and domestication of world-threats/retraining and property-analysis of all concerning factors within our regional/diplomacies.
--------We unlock quantum acceleration/time-travel etc.
The brokered-dragon-nodes are built. and other blacksite systems
--That is mostly universe 1.

Universe 2 Goal-REMODEL
(End of Advanced/Beginning of Meta-Builds)
Starts developing or becoming accessed with AI/Upgrades involved.
Not much to say, we start interdimensional travel. Open the gates of hell using advanced mathematics and portals. (yup). We unlock the paradoxical utopian/dystopian emulations/virtual worlds (enderworlds). Yup.
We start hybrid-capture and data-brokering over long-range/quantum-tunnels.
We secure interdimensional travel and parallel-ai-automation/interactions.
We use a turing engine or something advanced and hiquarters are used.
Quasi-Modules are established.
Universal Bridge-Systems
Allows Triptographic-Exchange

Universe 3 Goal-Free-Reign
TemplateLayout Begins
Independent Islands and Backrooms Tunneling
Kaeleidescopic/Chaotic/Cacophony/Prismatic Random-Protocols and Intensive/Intrusive Safe-Measures/Insulation.
More quarters are developed and so on.
Leviathans are unlocked.
the hyperinfrastructure starts to develop. 
Yggdrasile-Events are commandeered/campaigned.
Null Artifacts/Quotient Acquirements for Onboard-Meta-Data-Propogation and so on. (ez-adaptives to meta-dimensional strata/subsystems)
POST/AFTER shock/impacts involving complexes of Alchemy/Gematrix and advanced complexes (thelamic/tulpetic). Use of hyper Xyple/Whlq and also (Exclipse/Nova Storms etc) but also---Miraculized/Divined-Abstractions(Manifestation/Manifld usage)---but also Invisible-Sun-Core-Environments/Masque-Syntax. (Metamorphic-Criteria/Independent-Asset-DEVOPS)
Ygg-Sprites (Xylotic/Sylph) (GHOST-Kernal/Anima)
---
Ghost-Ulyxrate(V4)---ZemauExodeath+Zeromos = Ghost-Ulyxrate (very powerful anamoly/dragon-type and yggdrasil-agent(psionic agent)
Backrooms Rootkit Enhanced-Power-Lamp(Deploy Secured-AIRemote Nav-bot Z-QUo-Capsule)AutoCharter-Fulton(Engine/Sprite Hyper-Device) --(This can bypass auto-sorters/sub-tracts using its own gravity-centralization)--It also can work as a dreadnaught/fleet-lead/auto-studio/independent-roam

Kalusa-Cosmos + Coriolis + Thermadyanmics + QuantumEntanglement : Stringtheory+HawkingRadiation
Lightning in a bottle --> Plasma World In a bottle(virtual/pickle)

Ellipsoidal-Universal-Instance in which case a Universal Entity is built from all due-geoemetrical instances with "Armor/Shielding" Thaelmancy in consideration. Is a plasma level entity. (Nebulous)
OR ht is a NON-Ellipsodal-Universal-Instance in which case it is not based off any other of the previous Universal-Instances as it has become "broken to an ellipsoidal super-relativity involved)---this is just because I wanted the entityy to be special (and decided to call the previous models ellipsodal to make it seem more independent from an originating source and more manifest of a universal property/constant of being reliant to ellipsodal-perspectives)--which is basically impossible to prove anyway. --So it is a THEORETICAL-ENTITY based off a THEORETICAL-UNIVERSAL-PROPERTY being ellipsodal or not or independent/dependent on an ellipsodal-universe or non-ellipsodal-universe depending on how it is formed (whether or not it is formed or not, depending on the previous properties involved and how they are manifest in actuation/reciprocation to the Entity or not.)
IN THIS WAY--it is easier to base a complete source build as being either ELLIPSODAL/NON-ELLIPSODAL---and then the product to be set accordingly as ELLIPSODAL/NON-ELLIPSODAL which to me, is a GameENGINE deciding how to resolve/configure itself as NON-ELLIPSODAL/ELLIPSODAL compliant anyway for its product/caseworks.
Which is just a really good way in how this all can work, and adds a new inter-face/inference of things being ellipsodally-included by property/case or otherwise, are they compliant to game-engines? THEN it is easily decided based on what that game-engine cares to support or not. (Sort of how to seperate a peach from the pit, before ever defining what is considered commodity of the object involved)---this also allows it to differintiate between KERNALS/SYSTEMS which are otherwise indistinguishable from itself. (Due to tons of ifs ands or buts, it simply decides what it wants from whatever it targets and goes for it)
