STAGE ZERO:
Creating a Language that is NOT NESTED or is a sampled PEAK/LANGUAGE.(Metric or Library)
12x12x12

---BAREBONES BUILD (part1)--COMPOSE(UP)
1) Use of LS
Long pulse Short Pulse
2) Use of HolePunch/UnPunched
Recognizes for On/OFF or I/O based on expected holes/nonpunched holes
3)Use of I/O expectations for an ON system prefix.
4)Use of I/O expectations for an OFF system prefix.
5)Use of I/O expectations for a hanging-chad prefix
6)Use of I/O expectations for a HANGING-CHAD prefix to be HARD-CODED suffix
7)Use of Prefix Suffix to simulate expectation of a morse (character)
8)Use of Prefix Suffix to simulate expectations of a capitalization (character)
9)Match of morse and captilization as a KEYMAP for all characters a-z.
10)Match of KEYMAP to a TYPESET for all characters to be hard coded under match
11)Use of TYPESET in BIOS HARDCODES
12)Use of BIOS-HARDCODES to a binary match

---DRIVER BUILD (part2)--PATCH(UP)
13)Use of BINARY MATCH to a LIBRARY
14)Use of LIBRARY-HANGING to an INDEX
15)Use of INDEX to a LANG-COMPILE.
16)Use of LANG-COMPILE to allow EXPECTED ENCODE
17)Use of ENCODE to a SYMBOL
18)Use of SYMBOL to a DEFINITION
19)Use of DEFINITION to an ID
20)Use of ID to a Class
21)Use of Class to a FUNCTION
22)Use of Function to a STRING
23)Use of STRING to a SCRIPT
24)Use of SCRIPT to a PROGRAM

---Profile Quarter and Exchange (part3)
25)Use of PROGRAM to PROFILE
--Quartered-Profiles use Conditions to determine all factors/variables.
26)Recognition of Nested Languages(OCR or INSPECTION/INTERROGATION of clip/lens)
27)XSCOPY Scanning/Analysis of Character or Algorithm QUERY/INQUIRY.


---TROUBLESHOOTING (it makes mostly sense when things go haywire, but the way i said it is kinda blegh)
28)Priority Based Package-Management and Installation occurs
29)This results in typical standardized libraries and versions applied.
30)With prioritized packages and elevations set to a group method.
31)This also implies that there are pririotized methods which follow arrangements of variable/factored groups.
32)These are set to profiles and advised in their version/editions to be matched as needed.
33)These will also be patched in priority use as adapted or managed between programs and elevations.
34)This may take multiple-steps and configurations all of which are correalated under the order/chain of the surface-installs.
---
35)These are applied under schedule/append to protocol/actor for which is also adaptive, and set to debug. 
36)Errors/Conflicts/Issues/Problems are then benched/ignored and filed to a report in case of preference/conditional management.
