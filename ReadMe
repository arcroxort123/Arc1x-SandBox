THIS IS WHERE THE FINAL VERSION OF THE ARC1X SYSTEM GOES.
I am currently on my last nerve coding it all, but if you can do it for me be my guest.

I am looking for a very fast uncensored model and I have gone through a few that worked okay but trailed off and wouldn't code half the stuff I expected.
If i can managed to only go for 5 minutes a line including to update the code, maybe it will be around 80 lines (with some very big lines sometimes).
It will take 6,666.66666667 hours. Or 277.777 days to code at that rate.
