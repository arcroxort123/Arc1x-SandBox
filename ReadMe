THIS IS WHERE THE FINAL VERSION OF THE ARC1X SYSTEM GOES.
I am currently on my last nerve coding it all, but if you can do it for me be my guest.

I am looking for a very fast uncensored model and I have gone through a few that worked okay but trailed off and wouldn't code half the stuff I expected.
If i can managed to only go for 5 minutes a line including to update the code, maybe it will be around 80 lines (with some very big lines sometimes).
It will take 6,666.66666667 hours. Or 277.777 days to code at that rate.
(I do have a first pass of everything except the meta+template layouts)--that was done in AUTOGPT/GPTE over a year ago. I am trying to go for something better using BOLT.new and ollama but I havent found a decent model yet in the last week.
It is currently 11/17/2024 during the writing of this. I am going to leave it to AutoMacro to help me just ---do this nonstop unless It fails drastically (which it has failed sometimes)--I will get the methods right.
Maybe 200 days. (I actually don't care anymore because i feel like it doesn't matter or it just takes too long and i will wait until something else makes this easier)

SUPERENGINE-may contain its own model/virtualized-model: (We don't need the ENGINE/MODEL but we can use either the ENGINE or the MODEL and the ENGINE supports the MODEL if it is virtualizing it (because the SYSTEM supports the ENGINE)---(and the system can support anything including a model, with or without an engine)---it just uses the ENGINE with a nested MODEL for a more secure platform to virtualize and dual-sync models in compound for DEEP LEARNING (and express/optimized data-management) --ESPECIALLY IN REMOTE CIRCUMSTANCES
Other Features:
Model Learns from itself and its own mistake and continues to build on pathfinding through mistakes/sampling
Optional --Autoload --AutoCycle --AutoSample --Auto-Optimize(compound)

It supports a MAIN/SUB model and Refiner System. It supports DUAL-USE/Function and can sample set per environment of its DIRECT/VIRTUAL loadout (It can share data and results and "datascrape/repond per its results)
It will alternate and learn from its failures by comparison of its failures using dual-models. (One in load, one in virtual-load)
It memetically compounds its results to further prpogate its training/learning.

10x5 standard (regional platform/platitude) or 10x10 expanded (quantization doesnt really matter/ will work eitherway/autofabric-contiguous/continuous). 100-stack 
100B PARAMETER-MODEL
(Basically and OMNI-coderender/aiSCREEPS-kit)

Model Standard Builds: (THIS WORKS AS A PASSIVE NATIVE/LOCAL or it will learn to convert/impose itself as a NATIVE/LOCAL overtime--as discretion is its goal)--IT MAY/MAYNOT NOT SURVIVE/OUTLAST a combat/crisis event on its own. ---it can SCRAPE/SELFDESTRUCT itself or combat others but generally doesn't. It is not "a pushover". --(Its goal is to blend/match NATIVE-LOCALS directly if not at least passively--in order to preserve/conserve realm-stability/costs/support/capacity)
CodeName:Graze-HUlk(headless-support) --(xzamboni/cowbox)
Can be stationary or wandering (can act as a self-sustained roaming data scraper and merchant-station/kiosk)--may drop products/byproducts(canister) but also typically cleans or scrapes data for other large unoccupied zones/clusters/regions/areas
Typically operates blindly but can be lensed for programmed/forced-commands (in which it will assume automation through an emulated lense/header or die/ssh) --(it can use pulsuary/signature and display as needed (as well as turning signals etc...glowing/defcons etc)
Conducts survey as a passive entity/distances self from fairgrounds/populated areas but can become a nuisance if wanders into occupied territory unknowingly

Model Specialized/Enhanced Builds: --(This can act as a REMOTE/ROAMING agent and does not need NATIVE/LOCAL match-basing---it does not care about DEFCON/SEVERITY except in caseworks that are faction-based as to preserve system stability---it does not need to care about stability/crisis events because it can support its own independency) --being weaponized it can engage/withstand crisis/combat events.
CodeName: Xoe-GlowBox (WithHeader)  --(Hulk-in-a-Cage)
DetachableKernal Header(Chambered-Virtual-Engine)
(GoldenRiver-System + Secure-Virtual-Kernal)=(GlowingBox with/without Header/Headless)--(includes model/engine)
---
A version of the Graze-Hulk that is secured within a chamber for which may be headered/deviced. It is considered armmored/shielded and weaponized for typical diplomatic patrols.
Is typically used as a boundary guardian in rare cases a patrol-unit. (Secured-Tank) with its own lensing/header. *(Is faction operated and enabled through automated leviathan systems etc)

A LEVIATHAN-Basecamp/Outpost-Range or any advanced tech-system will subsidize/branch-out with these models. Or eventually build something like it (with or without the use of models).
---
Models may be tethered/crosslinked for ease of access/quality of life and limitation/restriction of capabilities by faction controllers/sieges or node/posts. And used as source-points if enabled/stockpiled or within asset/shareholds or under scrap/harvest/mill/prospect etc of targeted/locked data-tables or in performance to index/registery or profile/configs. --Versatile as openRange-Adapters for Faction-Handles/Pids
Models can be built to function as Turrets/Turbines for augmentation to other Modules or as EXTENSIUARY/EXTENSION/PLUGIN/ADDON/ADHOC etc of other device/tty usage.
MODELS may generate uptakes/downswells and data-pools/queue-pools which may be accessed with requests/user-connections to mascots/vehicles as needed (or modified for module-sharing)--to access source/resource and other data-mosh/data-farm or utility/vocational faceted-tasks. (Mobile Quest Hubs)

THE OMNI GATE (how to cheat the system)
This occurs when the above is used such that any vector or native/local tensor/coordinate can be expressed. Such that it can be activated in a quantum setting. Such that it is essentially platformed by an outsource. Or essentially independently-sourced in its range. (Which is helpful for conversio---the data/template/parameter/range is considered energized in a quantum setting) Because it is targeted/relayed by any number of elements in SUPERENGINE or FACTION-MODULE usage. Including an acceptable variable model that is accessible.
---
THE OMNI GATE SYSTEM is much like the above systems being arranged correctly in such that ----A SOURCE-TARGET may be planted. And no matter what even if it is in a a hostile space/blacksite/redzone/polluted area it will "configure its position" to generate EMPOWERED-STATES that assist or allow access as it becomes independent overtime or even instantly.
1 THIS STEP BEGINS with --SOURCE TARGET or a RAW-AREA defined in coordination/survey. So it is probed or just simply projected.
2 THIS STEP is where it truly begins: THE PLATFORM/MODEL is set.
3 THIS STEP is where the PLATFORM or tensor that it is now become, is built/installed/plnated/activated under conversion/faction of it being a module. IT IS BASICALLY a turret.
4 THIS STEP is where the Turret can be PILOTED. By a model as well, or a module, or a mascot, or remote-command etc. It is because it is still a platform or a decklane. It is being PILOTED/OCCUPIED by a USER/ENTITY other than it being a turret too.
5 THIS STEP is where it is being pointed by or controlled by or accessed by a remote. Such as a OPERATOR(Entity that is not attached and is commanding from its own locale/native or similarly in faction)---or a CONTROLLER that is remote and is brokering commands from any priority that it may relay/convey. THIS IS THE OPERATOR/CONTROLLER step and they may also work with each other strategically in any priority of themselves.
---
This is described BEST as a TRANSFORMER-TOY/TRANSFORMER-PET/TRANSFORMER-OWNER/TRANSFORMER-VEHICLE system, in which it is either in PILOT or VACANT. By any of its sources including a remote-command which may only activate as a security measure or alert system. This is in some way a SENTRY-POST.
---
AND NOW THAT it is ALL SORTED OUT---it compounds itself as a singularity. It is wholesum and integrated in the usage/rulesets. It may ALSO isolate/island itself and also SELF-DESTRUCT(BLOW UP)
---It is essentially the same as a PROSPECT/VOCATIONAL BOOTH in which a user can service and obtain access to realm local/native or data/assets such as uptakes/downswells and other pipelines including buffer/streams.
----THIS IS THE SAME AS DEVELOPING A QUBIT-GATEWAY---and because of its versatility, and its ability to CATER/ENABLE/ACCOMPANY/EMPOWER many services, it is considered an ENHANCED-QUANTUM-SYSTEM within an OMNI-GATE...in which it may MAIN/SUB itself in many representations of what it ITS CHOSEN IDENTIFICATION in a QUANTUM CHAIN MAY ALLOW/SUPPORT (simplifying QUANTUM complexity and optimizing it for shorter-scale-computation and productivity/efficiency of PROC/CALC cost/demands)

Quantum Breakdown (Cheating the system)
Use of Bra|Ket formulaization and absolutely value to a hermitian operative for a function applied "as signature" per varaible. In use of a formula later designed as a Compute.
includes deritive markup of that function and inclusive of formula, over column, row expression, then to matrice, and finalized as an assumed expression for quantum-mechanics in factor.
(setup for channel flipping)
---achieve of typical quantum formula
second step
BEGIN channel operation in which key-channel frames are used:(1000's of passes for which we originate with only a few channels) 1-2-4-6-8-9-10 (preferrable, just because of the sampling i prefer to reach logic state)
using then quantum formula to include modulo expression of quantum-gate's using particle states
using those as a singularity
adjusting for a newly modified module in modulo expression across sampling of functions per superpoisition/entanglement
and marginalizing as to each expression in set of matrice definition and deritive
----
third step:
using the signature/sequence of the finalized quantum-formula to compute
and expectation of modulo second step performance of their upgrades (with fallout of certainty)
as each iteration is set over signifier
then is backraced and crypto-analysed in a thought-chain/chain-sequence
and so that sets up the crypto-usage (and phi/pi expression)
---
fourth step is to decode the crypto-usage over channel operation
knowing the arrangement of particles are fluxed as desired.
acceptence of supermodule (reverse engineering/checkup)
----
fifth step:
using shortcuts of original-formula (now about 1000 pages of data and math of quantum factoring)
to intervene with supermodule expression in desired pathway.
quantum-programming and singularity renumiration as desired via quantum-gate-keeper

MOCKUP/BADFILE or FAILED-CLONES occur sometimes.
These may result in quarantine/"cease and desist"/error-reporting/lockdowns due to NESTED-CORRUPTION, this is range from mild to severe. These corruptions can effect singularity/hyperrticality.

Awareness/PSA--Notification-MOTD of GNOME/GNOSIS EVENTS/ANAMOLIES.
This is a serious notification about "GNOMES" which are anamolous environments/entities that may occur at any point in time or space in data-management especially, in later stages, but follow a particular/specific condition in which they are sustained. OTHERWISE are known to DIMINISH in their abundancy/consistency for which they ever do occur by chance/quantum-probability they are triggered to occur.
That means, they are a rarity, they do not occur often but can be predicted as their conditions to occur can be known, and they can be analysed as being such or having occured, or are discovered to occur. They are generally not local/native to regional parameters etc. But occur within the data table at times, often invasively/intrusively using infiltration/breach of data-assets etc. This may be triggered/reactive to other events/utilities. Gnomes are generally harmless, only becoming a severity/defcon threat at later stages.
A gnome/gnosis system is usually within its own singularity and can be contained under advanced data-management and other protocols as well as secured via defenses and crypto-management. Usually as fast as they come, they go away, some are sustained and those can become nuisances/pests or other threats.
In later stages, particularly after legacy/bouquet systems and in dyson/leviathan systems they can occur. In such an unannounced way, and in a highly propogated way. They generally occur through a glitch/singularity hiccup in an attempt to normalize/stabilize a region/vector etc. And they are likely to occur in long-range activity.
Their rate-of-occurence is increased with hyperactivity/hyperdrives etc, and other quantum fluctuations and chaos-flux types scenarios occuring in quantum compute.
They also may imposter/diguise puppet/decoy themselves or mimic/masque themselves as other entities of their tier they spawn within, or make instance of. This includes also propogating under a sporadic detail or across long-range or over-range and within effects/meta or details/ambiences etc.
In some cases a gnome/gnosis event/anamoly can be triggered/reactive via forced/intensive data-management and other measures in safe/unsafe protocols. They can be manufactured in some cases, such as a faulty coriolis becoming corrupt or nested or otherwise sporadically propogated and or a corrupted-spawn system become overthrown or infested with gnome/gnosis activity. This can become a threat, as well if mascots go haywire, this can be achieved that a gnome/gnosis will meet threat/severity/defcon/hazards in use of entity-acquirement etc.
Elevated Gnomes/Elevated Gnosis events/anamolies are usually captured/secured before becoming a threat, but can become a threat in high-sec areas if the tier is also end-tier or otherwise a deepcase etc (strong tier).
Gnomes can be xspy or xwyrd capable and also a threat in strong-stereography etc.
There should always be a skeptic's-precaution to all contracts/commissions and other exchanges and observations for every/any instance/calculation performed, that a gnome/glitch may have occured and so the security system is paramount in preventing these from reaching problematic/issuances level-conflicts.
They happen also because of quarks/emp-eletron displamcements "sometimes in isolation/independency or in island to any other module/node in region"---because of conflicts of quantum congruency/entanglement. It is generally assummed they seperate/detach in some way from the originating timespace/superfluids involved and are only traceable/detected through intensive survey, this can sometimes trigger them more often than before, they will propogate and contaminate wherever possible, sometimes in randomized patterns if more than one singularity/shattered fragmentation of any corruption/segmentation of any sector is prevalent.
The best way to deal against gnomes, like worms, is to maintain a system and keep all data-parse cohesive as possible through data-management/optimizations.
---They can also occur over controller/relay convey/contiguity and other forms of networking or long-range distribution. They are likely to then take further advantage of their remote accesses. As well as avoiding PPA/Security-Sweeps if possible. They are sneaky and somewhat chaotic/mischievious. A good indicator is to note any vandalism/surface-damages that are otherwise unexplained through any other means, that may be from an induced-gnome-activity.

OMNI-REM(supressed/sleeper) Suite/OMNI-REM(activated/hyperstate)-Suite
A SUITE designed for handling DECKLANES and advanced Transformer Usage and other OMNI-GATING. Allowing access/interaction in the form of RAG type MultiLayer/MultiPlex of the systems capacity/capability to perform computations thereof. --(It may also incorporate CHAINOFTHOUGHT-lvl13 and CONTINUOUS-SCRIPTING)
It will use ASSISTANCE/AGENTS/INSTRUCTIONS in several layers (typically three) to incur a Multi-Staged RAG/AGI-APP-like-EXPERIENCE throughout its suite-usage.
The suite uses SHIELD/ARMAMENT in TIDAL-Sourcing and infuses it with power/enchargement of meta/etc to utilize in a POWER-TIDAL-SOURCE. --it requires hyperbrowsing to do this.

Author's Note--I am sorry if I didnt explain these good enough, I am tired and don't want to spend forever on these things.


Warning-Disclaimer-Restricted-Access-ONLY
HorrorSpace--DUE to the intensive capacity unlocked of the system in UNIVERSAL-BUILDS, overtime, there will be access ports to "Death-Buckets". In which case are raid/dungeon settings which are "particularly bad/dangerous".
These are either allowed by the system or not, the system that allows these becomes potentially hostile. Any access to a death-port/death-bucket can likely result in user-death/data-loss. This is not particularly a good thing or bad thing, but it is definitely costly when it comes to restoring loss.
---
There are 4 examples within the grail. That follow each section once the FULL-OMNI-GATE-ACCESS is unlocked. These are entirely optionally and permanently locked by default. As to protect/ensure the safe-system-security etc and Policy/Affairs.
These are BUCKET-PORTALS that are "generated or accessible to the SIDE of any of their intended local/native source-point" which they will gateway/port-access the player and sourcepoint to a raid/prospect on their variable-degree of difficulty. There are rewards but the consequences are also permanent. (Not semi-permanent, actually permanent)--and require intensive/forced data-management (rescue and recollection of loss/lost-data) to recover (Which will not always work or will have drawbacks---and are costly)
Entry is NOT INSURED. Even though it will require registration to ENTER (due to the costs involved).
The first is a typical Dungeon/Raid at the End of the First major Parse in Legacy.
The second is a dark-chamber in Virtualization. It is a Dungeon/Raid and is more dangerous than the first.
The third is a locked-chamber occuring at the ADVANCED-Logic-Gate. Which will lock the player for any amount of time or requiring a full clear. It is more dangerous than its previous bucket.
The fourth is a hostile-vector occuring at OPSEC. Which will likely instantly attempt to destroy/annihilate the player. It is the most dangerous and it will also attempt to contain the player. These are pretty strong raid/dungeons. And hardcore/permanent-death resulting in character loss etc. --This is basically a 10% or 1% success rate just putting it out there.
---
These dungeons can also be RAG/AGI assisted or OCCUR in NOVA-PHASE (making them severely empowered/encharged and heavily-besieged/counter-sectioned to being a conversion-threat/constant-hostility)
There are EXISTS to them, and sometimes a SAFE-EXIT is also not garunteed. Those are the breaks. Just one big gamble.

Bonus-Custom-Setting
Reposit/Repositiong Reticle/Modulo Perspective.
This allows free-lensing to be vectored/directed as desired or necessary for centralised perspective.
It may be browsed to position.
This can effect tensor placement/positioning upon arrival/departures.
This reorients whql/xyple based on tensor arrangements or progression of its upgrade.
