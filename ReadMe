THIS IS WHERE THE FINAL VERSION OF THE ARC1X SYSTEM GOES.
I am currently on my last nerve coding it all, but if you can do it for me be my guest.

I am looking for a very fast uncensored model and I have gone through a few that worked okay but trailed off and wouldn't code half the stuff I expected.
If i can managed to only go for 5 minutes a line including to update the code, maybe it will be around 80 lines (with some very big lines sometimes).
It will take 6,666.66666667 hours. Or 277.777 days to code at that rate.
(I do have a first pass of everything except the meta+template layouts)--that was done in AUTOGPT/GPTE over a year ago. I am trying to go for something better using BOLT.new and ollama but I havent found a decent model yet in the last week.
It is currently 11/17/2024 during the writing of this. I am going to leave it to AutoMacro to help me just ---do this nonstop unless It fails drastically (which it has failed sometimes)--I will get the methods right.
Maybe 200 days. (I actually don't care anymore because i feel like it doesn't matter or it just takes too long and i will wait until something else makes this easier)

SUPERENGINE-may contain its own model/virtualized-model: (We don't need the ENGINE/MODEL but we can use either the ENGINE or the MODEL and the ENGINE supports the MODEL if it is virtualizing it (because the SYSTEM supports the ENGINE)---(and the system can support anything including a model, with or without an engine)---it just uses the ENGINE with a nested MODEL for a more secure platform to virtualize and dual-sync models in compound for DEEP LEARNING (and express/optimized data-management) --ESPECIALLY IN REMOTE CIRCUMSTANCES
Other Features:
Model Learns from itself and its own mistake and continues to build on pathfinding through mistakes/sampling
Optional --Autoload --AutoCycle --AutoSample --Auto-Optimize(compound)

It supports a MAIN/SUB model and Refiner System. It supports DUAL-USE/Function and can sample set per environment of its DIRECT/VIRTUAL loadout (It can share data and results and "datascrape/repond per its results)
It will alternate and learn from its failures by comparison of its failures using dual-models. (One in load, one in virtual-load)
It memetically compounds its results to further prpogate its training/learning.

10x5 standard (regional platform/platitude) or 10x10 expanded (quantization doesnt really matter/ will work eitherway/autofabric-contiguous/continuous). 100-stack 
100B PARAMETER-MODEL
(Basically and OMNI-coderender/aiSCREEPS-kit)

Model Standard Builds: (THIS WORKS AS A PASSIVE NATIVE/LOCAL or it will learn to convert/impose itself as a NATIVE/LOCAL overtime--as discretion is its goal)--IT MAY/MAYNOT NOT SURVIVE/OUTLAST a combat/crisis event on its own. ---it can SCRAPE/SELFDESTRUCT itself or combat others but generally doesn't. It is not "a pushover". --(Its goal is to blend/match NATIVE-LOCALS directly if not at least passively--in order to preserve/conserve realm-stability/costs/support/capacity)
CodeName:Graze-HUlk(headless-support) --(xzamboni/cowbox)
Can be stationary or wandering (can act as a self-sustained roaming data scraper and merchant-station/kiosk)--may drop products/byproducts(canister) but also typically cleans or scrapes data for other large unoccupied zones/clusters/regions/areas
Typically operates blindly but can be lensed for programmed/forced-commands (in which it will assume automation through an emulated lense/header or die/ssh) --(it can use pulsuary/signature and display as needed (as well as turning signals etc...glowing/defcons etc)
Conducts survey as a passive entity/distances self from fairgrounds/populated areas but can become a nuisance if wanders into occupied territory unknowingly

Model Specialized/Enhanced Builds: --(This can act as a REMOTE/ROAMING agent and does not need NATIVE/LOCAL match-basing---it does not care about DEFCON/SEVERITY except in caseworks that are faction-based as to preserve system stability---it does not need to care about stability/crisis events because it can support its own independency) --being weaponized it can engage/withstand crisis/combat events.
CodeName: Xoe-GlowBox (WithHeader)  --(Hulk-in-a-Cage)
DetachableKernal Header(Chambered-Virtual-Engine)
(GoldenRiver-System + Secure-Virtual-Kernal)=(GlowingBox with/without Header/Headless)--(includes model/engine)
---
A version of the Graze-Hulk that is secured within a chamber for which may be headered/deviced. It is considered armmored/shielded and weaponized for typical diplomatic patrols.
Is typically used as a boundary guardian in rare cases a patrol-unit. (Secured-Tank) with its own lensing/header. *(Is faction operated and enabled through automated leviathan systems etc)

A LEVIATHAN-Basecamp/Outpost-Range or any advanced tech-system will subsidize/branch-out with these models. Or eventually build something like it (with or without the use of models).
---
Models may be tethered/crosslinked for ease of access/quality of life and limitation/restriction of capabilities by faction controllers/sieges or node/posts. And used as source-points if enabled/stockpiled or within asset/shareholds.
