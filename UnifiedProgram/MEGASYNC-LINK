Arc1x-SANDBOX and some other prompts made by windsurf. Full Fille is 35.GB
It shows up as a website that simply says its running and can detect changes to modules.
IDK if it was worth anything, I spent a week spamming prompts and asking it to conintue in windsurf before my trial ran out. I would have of course continued the entire build if it would simply accept local-llm's (IT DOESNT)--even when addons technically its crap.
It is made in WINDDOWS 11 for a user named RXTO1 if that matters which it probably does.
