This isn't important I just wanted to type something.

Essentially use a programmed codestring that will call upon a chart based off the language i am using, the chart incorporates dwords which are expanded into hexadecimal from binary, and that binary represents a morse/pulse to the effect of a codestring composition that is essentially the base language of most of the computing chain used. --actually this is complicated--let me get into detail here:


I will use a language to formulate a complex chain of pre-programmed words. So that these words represent a function or process that is based on a collection or chart of other keywords or dwords, that are used in computing, which represent hexadecimal and assignments to binary, which are morse and pulse in their most basic use. The ram is accessed to circumvent the need to spell out these symbolic-I/O states.
==
This is condensed in a chart which is identified by the language I am using, to recognize the key-mapping and correalate under a ram-selection of previously loaded bios/terminal setups. I essentially have a framework of language-signatures to represent the same bios/diagnostics involved of the overall bios supported by the active machine-hardware.
==
Drivers may be built as well with these languages to accept recognized patterns/codestrings and compute them accordingly based off the language involved, such that it will calculate as to what exact input is performed, in transcoding a function/request into a resolved/target-configuration. It will also source these to a destination in ram for checksum/file-checks in compliance to driver builds.
==
Once the checksum is passed it is tabulated/extrapolated where needed, typically under the selected language and all its represented possible-interpretations as its type-set(id) and may be grouped to a scripted-request.
That allows a ram-look-up where processes may rely on the specific encodes/languages in preference, and apply under variable/label to the type-set and file-print. The file may then be also compiled and saved to consist of the necessary scripted values within its paramaters as a file-build.
--
The type-set to file-build process can then be easily templated and programmed based on this schematic, so it is afforded/allocated as a preset condition or expectation, and acts as a script-function whenever the file is called by its variable/label. This allows ram to access its print in allocation so long as the file remains in the destination/path or schematic-usage. It may be based/picked from its target destination/path and sourced in localized formats per ram-usage/request and therefore it is now supported (so long as it remains allocated in the expectations of its request)--hosted/saved
--
The allocated entry can also be registered to be called by an indexing system or file-table. Much like the previous checksum, as it is now in a saved state, and it can be memory chained based off that index/allocation in RAM.
The process may then be substituted/supplicated where applicable in other codestrings or computes based off a command/terminal or shell support of a generated framework (simulated hardware).
---
The Framework is now allocated based off simulated hardware throughout its own processor/pipeline. The shell of which is now transferring encoded codestrings and supporting ram-call through indexed-allocations. As it is compiled through architecture and rebuilt over a source/gateway. This typically involves CPU and RAM but can involve PLC mitigation/mediation.
---
The drivers may assist in defined simulated returns of simulated hardware. This begins the service-exchange of hardware source/gateways. In which a workflow/pipeline for that hardware achieves allocations/file-prints based for RAM/DEVICE interpretation. The drivers may convey these as pagefiles to their target, and fileprint as needed for indexing.
---
This creates a definition per codestring to assist with a project-infrastructure, in which the architecture has compiled a full chain of data to its target-destination and may call it appropriately per its schematic usage. The workflow/pipeline is now operating as a data-service under interpretation of the pagefiles involved, and directed to their compatible drivers. Which convey to the necessary shell/command as data-chained. This allows for profiles of the project-infrastructure to be assessed as a data-asset in exchange/service over source/gateway. Where implicit/explicit checksum/pagefiles may be substituted/supplicated in a recompile/configuration of the original/originating conditions defined.
This is the test-product or model-sample.
---
The test product is finalized as a model-sample. And is redefined as the hosted parse/profile or simulation-frame which is supported of the framework, and expressed in ram-allocation for which is hosted in source/gateway to the service. And the service presents its interpretation of the expectations and codestrings in schematic to a localized frame. The frame may be printed/saved a newly/secondary profiled-file-build. And used in call/request to independent-parameters of its originated/original frame. This is then debugged. Once it passes compatibility or match to its previous compared-frame, it may be supported in full composition (exposition) to be integrated as shell/compute.
---
This is still a type-set, and made complex and large by pagefiles, but are set to profile in case of need of request/call. So these are defined by their ram-address/chain-interpretations. These may be organized through index and are prepared by identified or tested expectations in definition of target condition. They also have been indexed and pagefiled in exposition. They match/set by correct composition/express in order-of-appearance/default-arrangement. These can be restructured to their desired address and profile.
---
The type-sets are then grouped in this way or as serviced in request/call as functioned/resolved targeted/configured by source/gateway. This can also be template/schematic based on test/sample and expressed condition/parameter.
---
****
This completes the base language-block. We can begin to assign language products to the groups such that we begin to build with the language we have.
--
Profile a = a
Profile shift = shift
Profile A = sourced profile a :sourced by profile shift
This is now a term. We use this term to construct A from a.
We now can define this term as Aa.
and so we can apply this term as variable for A or a by a sourced shift (or not). It will capitalize a when it includes shift. Therefore A is a+shift.
Now we assign new profiles and terms for the alphabet and other symbols.
---
So we build all the profiles - Profile a-z
We apply the profile-shift to all those profiles a-z.
We now have profiles A-Z
We will also have the terms built or build them manually for Aa Bb Cc and so on.
The terms are also used for the symbols !@#$%^&*()_ and numbers 1234567890 etc and so on.
ONCE we have a decent collection of terms we can generate a decent KEYMAP.
(Technically we already have a keymap in use, this "new keymap" applies to the LANGUAGE we are using NOW)
So we build out the language as needed to include basic-terms. And we can rebuild the entire above process in the new language using a keymap we just made.
THIS CAN BE DONE IN MANY WAYS, i just decided to use it this way, because I dont want to think too much)--there are better more optimized ways (but not really that different) in how PROFILES/TERMS may be built or applied to each other. It comes down to the math at that point really. But in the end, having the keymap just perform the necessary keys as integers, without having to BUILD OUT INTEGERS/CONSTANTS per every letter/symbol we want to use or collaborate with in different TERMS all requiring a significant amount of language processing is what is important.
----
So that gets us one step closer to optimizing our language builds as needed.
And we can begin to quickly structure LANGUAGE BASE and processing of the above scripts as needed for interpretation of the language-selection involved. We then can apply CROSS-OVER languages and begin type-sets for those based off whatever keymap is needed to perform in those type-sets/interpretations. Having the compatible keymaps/language-interpretations for the intended scripts is important, and can be ultimately transcoded using the desired language, or point to a cross-over of langauges involved, per script used by adjusting the target-interpretation for each script/language used.
---
So basically this whole process is already done and outsourced by other developers and I just wanted to put my own spin on it.

It also gets debugged for additional ERRORS/CHECKS/FLAGS/POINTS in optimization to fix everything anyway.
This lanaguage can be optimized/reinforced(bolstered) or BLOATED/CRITICAL(expendable) and can be used as a toss-up/toss-out for potential word-fixing/script-working. To automate under "potentially broken services" so that "less thinking can be involved" as long as a product can be interpretated/decoded then it probably doesn't matter on the endpoint being slightly "junked-up" and can be pruned per desired language anyway.
USING a "flowery-language" does not matter except down to preferences anyway. It can be used strategically or any other way or recreationally, its intended to achieve some method/purpose, even if it "sort of prolongs a compute based on the words or arrangements used"--it will eventually get around to do what it is needed.
Cacophonous Language can be somewhat viral/undesrirable so be careful as to make sure you are not "being interpretated as a viral-corroborator/sabotuer by using a cacophonous-language".
Using a broken language or deprecated language, there may be "points of interest in that language to use, while OTHER points of interests may be COMPLETELY ABSENT from that language entirely---so just a precaution about using ancient/decoded blacksite languages".
---
A roundRobin/hypercritical language preference may be preferred when using "acceptable parameters and expectations of limitations". (Which either is prioritized of, may be the difference in a prefferable/fast outcome depending on what type of langauge is used)---however it is generally considered that a default language is being used unless otherwise an interpretation calls for a specific edition/version or special-case language anyway.
So that is the JOY/TRICKERY of using language-sets.

*************************
To Recap here on Language:
It starts out as morse or long/short punch. These are parsed/sequenced to achieve I/O and sensory.
These permute as much as needed per se, to achieve logistic/basic table-systems and patterns for binary. It achieves binary transmission in each strain/chain of listened freqs which are then closed.
This is mostly anologue in process, but can become automated for computation.---we use it for raw-codec i/o tranmissions---and we can use it for morse sampling to assist in byte-constructs. These are good for very basic values and only in parameters (there is some excess and ploss should be noted in each strain)
ANWAYS--we like to use Hexidecimal for computation, and this can further allow for sha encryption and so on.
---
That is the basic stuff we can also formulate a basic keymap/calc process with this. Infact we can adjust it for legitimate calculation process later using mod-chips/logics/controls and plc even. Advancing to graphing/diagnostic calcs.
---
So we apply our language system and tables for the keymap. Then we can begin sampling the keymap and performance of it based on any amount of morse/binary/hex/keymap-assignments which are printed/parsed/cycled/compute upon whatever shortcut/analog is used in assignment/designation of that transmit/encode.
Which is very primitive and requires analogue/indexing for automation.
However the process is more or less the same.
----
----
The process is then scripted out as necessary in partition space as a lanaguage which is used in RAM-processing.
So we can always have that on call/queue or pending-request.
---
---
We begin advancing the LANGUAGES for DWORDS/KEYWORDS etc. And these are indexed as per the language/encode in use.
We can also begin attempts of transmitting/transcoding their index/entry through registry and frameworks until it is fully incorporated/matched/supported/simulated.
---
We build the langauge based on the interpretation of the system.
We can begin variable/labels and use these in ram. And the ram can express them per value/parameter of each selection or preference of language, to the template/schematic for which it represents as allocated/indexed. It will resolve/configure based off the allocation/index loaded/referenced.
---
If everything correalates to the CPU/Architecture/framework/infrastructure of the system/simulation then it may be set to host/gate/source/service as described (and likely will be predetermined by interpretation to have matched/compatibile)
IN RAM, also It will set a definition of its targets/profiles for which it is request/called. By utilizing pagefiles that are sampled as its parse/address.
This will distribute the necessary products for which is represented as type-set. (And the type set is represented by the language sample-model)
---
THIS is generated by the model-sample expressions and can be file-print within its condition/group that is parameter/valued as interpreted. (Allowing ram-storage and cache usage) --which may also be then copy/pasted if scripted correctly for copy/pasting.
---
In advanced editors: IT can be copy/pasted or supplicated/substituted AS-IS.
In functions/shell variables/terms it may also be used AS-IS those varaibles/terms allow.
---
From that point it may be assembled/compiled in automation of scripts/references to the arrangements of its language block is indicated. (This allows for chunk by chunk composition/exposition as well)--it allows for fast-assembly/whole-comparitive models to be sequenced as needed under an assessed-checksum/table-conversion of the language-service.
