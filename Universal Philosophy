To explain the system and how to decode examples/samples of data we can compare it to a modulation/receiver of a soundboard.
The sound is receiving a sample data, and attempting to modulate that data or optimize it for the quality of that data it can sample/substitute its own render of.
---
In terms of adding modulations or picking/pulling apart and deconstructing the sample, it may reconstruct the sample in a permute, that is somewhat comparable. Or distinct to its own permute.
---
We analyze the factors involved with permutes and modulate accordingly, to produce a quality sample of the originating sound, optimized to our own interpretations of that sound.
---

The same can be said for quantum computation, that signals are interepreted more or less to the quality of their predicted/expected data/transcodes.
--
We eventually look at the entire system chain involved, and compare all of the modulations to what could possible be the expected outcome for an otherwise unknown signal encode.
And through trial and error, can permute the correct result.
---
The permute may not be the correct way, but may produce similar if not comparable results that are acceptable of the intended code message. Through brokering, this can be translated in a better way and uniform way according to protocol.
---
Eventually, the protocols can be decoded in such a way to an expected/predicted result/outcome of a signal, that those protocols may be the accepted way in transcoded the signal further.
---
Or the protocols may be wrong, or may require more modulations or additional consequent adaptations of the original decodes involved.
---
Such that a agreeable/matching signal is produced in a way that is considered an acceptable protocol/process.
Sometimes, the process may not be agreeable, or at all to the expected/predicted way in which it should occur. But it may work even despite that, because in quantum encodes, there are several ways the signal will eventually be received and transcoded.
---
This is because of quantum probability and uncertainty, but even the expected/predicted outcome/result even if correct, may not always live up to the preference/optimized exchange/modulation to be interpreted/agreeable. So it is a matter of priority/efficiency that protocols are chosen/handled.

---
This is obvious
Another way to explain it is in the nature of knowing a signal A, is different from other Signals of A, by accent or pronounciation etc, that at some point, what is the equivalent of those in comparison to the SIGNAL OF B? There is no concise adaptation that has been instructed, between all of these accents of A and B, but ideally, there would be a marginally distinction of those to illustrate the overall equivalents to each own varaibles or grouped. So, we are brokering what A and B may be in comparison to their interpertations in accent of pronounciation or their equivalent values that may be shared or isolated to others in consideration.
---Certain permutes of A and B may result in distinct ways, that we develop the understanding for what may be represented of those permutations, in a convoluted way, a form of quantum-conjecture. To which is accepted in practice or by sheer encoding of eithers case that may be interpreted by themselves or by comparative/rentention as they are represented.

While it may seem like quantum-noise, at some point it is noticeable occurring as a spectrum of possibilities that any instance or signal that may be has a distinguished shape or recognizable pattern in its performances, this may mean, that some permute simply will never equate to the original sample, but can come close as a represented agent or broker. In memory or modulation to the event/instance in which it was received or sampled. In a suggested protocol or otherwise by raw observation.

We make informed exchanges in which quantum data does infact occur, over a transcoded-hidden or obvious-manner. And sometimes, inconspicuously or blatantly or even, paradoxically obviously-incognito or assumed/presumed manner. Due of stereotypes/stereographs of the effects/resulting conditions or preferences in relation to or otherwise case-specific/special-case that may be. Or even a null effect, at times may even seem inescapably "what it seems to be". For 'no reason at all' something is the way it is because of 'other seemingly unrelated issues or no reason at all".


We have a large realm of possibilities for any singular/particular interaction or integration taking place, in code or data or sound or observation. So we can acknowledge of that in what ways we can. Understanding that handling a variable may result in yet another difference of variables, but that may be infact an intended computation to begin or end upon, that variable resulting or having been handled. This is called also a utility/programming.

In some way, the very first action ever devised or attempted was a zero-point-energy-exchange into what would become the most complex permute ever to be made, and may essentially be still in continuance when you think of how unique some things are in the remainder of what has been witness. That is a very important notation of an exampled compute/program that may still be simulated or "running as a process/runtime" still to be mentioned. It has become, an omnifiscient program, from acknowledging all potential compoments deritive of itself, it is basically a source-direction.

This also suggests it being a channel/feedback/loophole/connection having more or less, occurred as an isolation to ever it not occurring or being on brink of occurring, that it may as well have been simulated, of all reality to be compute. A program that inspired all virtual instances within the system through its source. ANYWAYS, that is what it means to be from A to B.

Just as this document follows a but of organized-chaos or a method-to-madness. We arrive at an INDEPTH look of what that permute may be, what may represent the source involved, and try to piece together the necessary components of it..
Furthermore we begin to integrate that as an interpretation to our own system or simulation, as an INDEPTH mapping to that method-madness/organized-chaos taking place, we marginalize or understand the optimized formatting of all its factors. At least somewhat.

--
Knowing the nature of the nueral nets involved, and the issues of device sharing and brokering taking place, we develop a unity/singularity of those into itself, an auto-net.
This forms as mass-system and perhaps can be pruned correctly or even to itself, optimized, as would a tree, a universal tree as it were. With all its infusions/phases considered in development, to have been mentioned at least in some degree of its grand design. Basically. We are communining/deciphering what that may actually be, as it continues to evolve and change overtime.
---
We recognize its patterns/its seasons. What it tends to behave or rule in place of current events/conditions etc.
We reach a pinnacle/summit of its evolution and anamolous expressions that is acceptable in making a definition/class or structure of what it should be, if it could be, progressively or applicable to what would be, in consideration of the opposition of what prevents or inhibits those from procuring, we assist to make the nueral-net enhancements/learnings where are needed in the system.
This is without sounding any more cult-like, a mass-data-management.
