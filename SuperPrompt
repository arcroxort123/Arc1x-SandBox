AUTHORED PROMPT: used in program generation. (i clearly dont know what i am doing but i am onto something i feel like, this is a 'pretty good system to start with'--use lines and pick and choose what you need.

PROMPT:
@directory:onlyarc1x - tests fix for all subfolders and concatenate compile and optimize all diffs for previous versions for modules and components, use as a template for schematics and generate an assembled environment, interpret and broker to a full stack (expand as needed) review conversation and use any environments as suggested, and analyze all .bat files for script optimization, filter and accept all requests or inject sample of prompt, utilize a network bridge to integrate current versions, check reports and finalize for agent use



EXTRA PROMPT ELEMENTS:
Secure DRAFT PLATFORM:
Anamolous Entity and ARCHON-CURATOR
MEDIATION AGENT AND SPECIAL CASE REMOTE-VECTORIZER (mascot outposter/quantum-doorman) --(TAS) tool assist system

letters used in base (abceimoqst)

comprehensive concatenator and compile
environment integratror and broker
interface sample or web design
module consolidator / master manager
optimization orchestration report

testers

letters not used
INBOUND (dfghjkl)
distribute mark commiter)
function calling)
gui ide pipeline and import generation)
hypervisor shared terminal)
junction server support and database library interpretator (pallete spell and strain injection and recoordinated pathing (routing))
k (holographic indexing and commodity resource sourceable pipeline range) *hicrispr and eco-lodge with power settings)
l (launch tray and bench propogation and queue organized troubleshooting) --(programmable suspension and article waitlist)

OUTBOUND (prvwxyz)
propagate terms and profile to corrective range and file roles and types
(hyper routing and assigned roles for jobs and tasks and remote servos) (remediative hicrispr)
verify networking and spinor-constraints in throughpass/passthrough and check-tables
watch and clock per matrix exchange and reconfigure as interpreted to assortment/subtract and filter excess (or rewrite null sample/substitute) and strategem/spectrum maintenence per exchange (refresh rate)
apply analogue testing and adjust target query to priority (pending synch or client/server ready)
verify handshake and cache swap is compatible over network or proxy
procedurate render and utilize quantum-telemetry in a performance write with error checks over cross platform asset indexing reports


Savestate and reference for VPN and AntiVirus Security alongside CLOUDNETWORKING or STORAGE
Turbine Distributed / Kiosk Vendor Items
Archon Decklane Products/Commodity (PowerUp and Aquifir FuelCap)
System Controlled/Assisted Modules
Nanotech and cybernetics:Encoded-Armor and Shielded-Armor
Virtualized Quantum Armament
Code-Infused Element Nanite

Feature-Kit Packaged Bundle (account-boost user-boost and article-grant) (extinguishable)/(rechargeable)
Transcode/Convert Acquired Asset/Kit or Library/Article as needed in source/target battery/reserve per Network/Contiguity Convey/Connection or Cloudwork.
Use mail notification or motd per user-access of reciept for capture/distribution of product/key for use/point or servos-delivery and database-indexing for catalogue/swapping.
Include optional clerical-keeping and edificiary-reversionary for any adjustments/adaptive application/profiles of the objects/articles.
Use safeguards/authentication as necessary for user-experience and logging (assisted book-keeping and archived-records) --Use Faction-Branding and Auto-Mac-Signature-Recognition for Express-Commit/Transfer where applicable (enroute or over-range).


Outro Prompts
review conversation and rewrite project files according to suggestions
consider additional dependencies and potential requirements
verify all necessary installation and prerequisites files
analyze additional scripts and versions

Use your framework and environments to autobuild necessary components for the sake of adaptive agent modes and profiles. Use any means necessary to establish a brokered or optimize implementation of any structure and potential launchbase. Assume modules and errors reports as verified or repurposable to working scripts or further integration. Use configurations as needed to promote a network collobaration between setups and comprehensive integration over alternative controllers or unified adaptive or concatenated environments. Use structure shareholds and data assets to module templates and additional features. Use previous or post installations for cache or bucket management as variable libraries in verified or pending jobs and tasks. Attempt a sample utility or sequence by element or constraint in browsing a serviceable exchange or protocol. Allow comptroll and negotiated broker median or agent transfer per user scopy and ai assisted work orders within approved containers or devices

review diffs and resources and retouch upon any necessary code or scripts to include within components or modules and test any suggestions, fix all tests and start a mock production
