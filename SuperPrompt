AUTHORED PROMPT: used in program generation. (i clearly dont know what i am doing but i am onto something i feel like, this is a 'pretty good system to start with'--use lines and pick and choose what you need.

PROMPT:
@directory:onlyarc1x - tests fix for all subfolders and concatenate compile and optimize all diffs for previous versions for modules and components, use as a template for schematics and generate an assembled environment, interpret and broker to a full stack (expand as needed) review conversation and use any environments as suggested, and analyze all .bat files for script optimization, filter and accept all requests or inject sample of prompt, utilize a network bridge to integrate current versions, check reports and finalize for agent use


EXTRA PROMPT ELEMENTS:
Secure DRAFT PLATFORM:
Anamolous Entity and ARCHON-CURATOR
MEDIATION AGENT AND SPECIAL CASE REMOTE-VECTORIZER (mascot outposter/quantum-doorman) --(TAS) tool assist system

verify networking and spinor-constraints in throughpass/passthrough and check-tables
watch and clock per matrix exchange and reconfigure as interpreted to assortment/subtract and filter excess (or rewrite null sample/substitute) and strategem/spectrum maintenence per exchange (refresh rate)
apply analogue testing and adjust target query to priority (pending synch or client/server ready)
verify handshake and cache swap is compatible over network or proxy
procedurate render and utilize quantum-telemetry in a performance write with error checks over cross platform asset indexing reports
