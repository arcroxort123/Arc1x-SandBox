AUTHORED PROMPT: used in program generation. (i clearly dont know what i am doing but i am onto something i feel like, this is a 'pretty good system to start with'--use lines and pick and choose what you need.

@directory:onlyarc1x - tests fix for all subfolders and concatenate compile and optimize all diffs for previous versions for modules and components, use as a template for schematics and generate an assembled environment, interpret and broker to a full stack (expand as needed) review conversation and use any environments as suggested, and analyze all .bat files for script optimization, filter and accept all requests or inject sample of prompt, utilize a network bridge to integrate current versions, check reports and finalize for agent use
