This describes a build process which I guess I will code together later. Actually I am just lazy and will only describe it because I can't code
Using Windsurf or something like it to basically achieve this pattern of workflow:

Source a workspace or refer a destination:
(and it begins to use model-ai-engineering to develop):
--Step1 Samples
Select Snippet or CodeStrings into workspace/destination or file or general collection.
Excerpt additional snippet/codestring or Sample multiple files/Collections for the workspace directory 
--Step2 Ties
Tie together multiple samples
Rerun:Tie together original or additional samples .
--Step3 Tethers
Tether together multiple ties
Rerun: Tehther together multiple ties or samples
--Step4 References/Scripts
Construct References/Scripts from snippets/collections or samples/ties/tethers
Expand Constructs from all of the above previous snippets/collections or samples/ties/tethers/modules, with additional References/Scripts that may be included/apply-as-needed
--Step5 Modules(any stage)
Use Constructs and Modules to complete/merge project/builds or expand on additional project builds/branches.
Complete stack/infrastructure as project build or expand project builds/branches.
