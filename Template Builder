This describes a build process which I guess I will code together later. Actually I am just lazy and will only describe it because I can't code
Using Windsurf or something like it to basically achieve this pattern of workflow:

Source a workspace or refer a destination:
Select Snippet or CodeStrings into file or collection
Excerpt File or Sample multiple Collections
--
Tie together multiple samples
Rerun:Tie together original or additional samples .
--
Tether together multiple ties
Rerun: Tehther together multiple ties or samples
--
Construct Modules from snippets/collections or samples/ties/tethers
Expand modules from all of the above previous snippets/collections or samples/ties/tethers/modules
--
Complete stack/infrastructure as project build or expand project builds.
