This describes a build process which I guess I will code together later. Actually I am just lazy and will only describe it because I can't code
Using Windsurf or something like it to basically achieve this pattern of workflow: Idk, I wanted to make it as complicated and streamlined as possible.

--Step0 Source/Platform
Source a workspace or refer a destination:
Rerun:(and it begins to use model-ai-engineering to develop):
--Step1 Samples
Select Snippet or CodeStrings into workspace/destination or file or general collection.
Rerun:Excerpt additional snippet/codestring or Sample multiple files/Collections for the workspace directory 
--Step2 Ties
Tie together multiple samples
Rerun:Tie together original or additional samples .
--Step3 Tethers
Tether together multiple ties
Rerun: Tether together multiple ties or samples
--Step4 References/Scripts
Construct References/Scripts from snippets/collections or samples/ties/tethers
Rerun:Expand Constructs from all of the above previous snippets/collections or samples/ties/tethers/modules, with additional References/Scripts that may be included/apply-as-needed
--Step5 Modules/Stacks (any stage)
Construct Modules/Stacks to complete/merge project/builds or expand on additional project builds/branches.
Rerun:Complete stack/infrastructure as project build or expand project builds/branches.
--Step6 Compile
Correalate All Workspace/Destination/Codestrings/Snippets/Files/Collections/Excerpts/Directories/Ties/Samples/Tethers/References/Scripts/Constructs/Expansions/Modules/Stacks/Project/Builds/Branches/Infrastructure/Steps/Inclusions/Applications and Remediations/Exemptions to be Debuged/Tested
Correalate compiles to additional assembly under environment and Environment settings.
